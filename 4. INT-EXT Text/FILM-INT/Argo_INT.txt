(re: Bob Anders)
This guy's the director.
MENDEZ
Can you teach a guy how to be a
director in a day?
CHAMBERS
You can teach a rhesus monkey to
be a director in a day. Look, if
you're gonna do it, you've got to
do it. The Khomaniacs are fruit
loops, but they have cousins
selling eight tracks and prayer
rugs on La Brea. You can't build
cover stories around a movie that
dsn't exist. You need a script.
You need a producer.
MENDEZ
I'm the producer.
CHAMBERS
No, you're not. Associate' at
best. If it's a twenty-million
dollar Star Wars rip-off, you need
somebody who's a somebody to put
his name on it.
Here we see some AUTOGRAPHED 70s CELEBRITY 8X10s hanging

The waiter brings a bill.
CHAMBERS
Somebody respectable. With

And there's LESTER SIEGEL, a semi-legendary producer in
his semi-legendary seventies. He's equal parts bookie

SIEGEL
Thank you. Very respectful.
KLEIN
You're done, Lester. You've gotta
get your cataracts fixed and read

But see -- it worries me, what you
said, and I'll tell you why. A
couple weeks back I was sitting in
Trader Vic's enjoying a Mai Tai
when my pal Warren Beatty came to
wish me well and we had a little

worth the buffalo-shit on a
nickel. So.
Lester takes some documents out of a folder.
SIEGEL
The way this looks to me --
through the cataracts, I grant you
-- is that you can either sign

Nah. They'll kill you long before

Nicholls and Tony walk towards the inner courtyard.
NICHOLLS
When you land, you should go

the sound of a woman screaming in Farsi.
Three lanes away, at the outgoing immigration station, a
Revolutionary Guard is dragging away the woman's HUSBAND.
The Immigration Official stamps Tony's passport -- takes

Chinese-made Swiss watches, banks, mosques, butchers,
fabric stores, gold stands. Boys with hand-trucks loaded
down with piles of fabric cut through the crowd. Older

sinned.
Ds he know? Ds he not know? Is he trying to trick
her? His opacity makes it impossible to know. He holds
his look to her -- and she holds hers.
Reza indicates an exit to the street.

-- and Sahar, so dignified and stony she is almost
shaming these men --
SAHAR
Everyone in this house is a friend
of Iran.
Khalkali makes his decision. He wordlessly turns to go.
ARGO - Final 86.
The CROWD heckles the Houseguests as they walk toward the
exit.
Sahar calmly closes the door.
After she ds, she lets the facade go. All of a sudden
scared. Maybe she tears up. Either way, it's clear she
knows the stakes of the game she is playing.
The aftermath. The Houseguests, badly shaken, come
inside. Each dealing with shock and adrenaline.
Ken Taylor comes up next to Mendez and, for once,
Taylor's ambassadorial calm is breaking.
TAYLOR
They drew you out there to take
your picture.
MENDEZ
Nobody broke.
At the door to the residence, Tony can see Pat Taylor,
holding Sahar's hand, both looking spooked as the
Houseguests come inside.
TAYLOR
(SOBERED NOW)
And tomorrow?
A beat on Mendez, who stamps out his cigarette and
follows.
MENDEZ
Tomorrow they'll be ready.
We start to hear the sound of the evening's call to
prayer, amplified over a megaphone, in the distance.
THEN --
223-224 OMITTED 223-224
ARGO - Final 87.
Mendez holds a passport and some papers in front of Bob
Anders' face. It feels late. The Houseguests are tired,
sweating, sitting around a dining room. Mendez, sleeves
rolled up, drilling them. The ARGO STORYBOARDS are
scattered around the room.
MENDEZ
Where was your passport issued?
Bob Anders dsn't know. ANGLES ON the Houseguests.
ANDERS
Vancouver.
MENDEZ
Where were you born?
BOB ANDERS
Toronto.
MENDEZ
Toronno like piranha. Canadians
don't pronounce the T.
LEE SCHATZ
Some border guard's gonna know
that?
MENDEZ
If you're held for questioning,
they'll bring in somebody who
knows that.

Your job on the film.
J STAFFORD
Producer.
MENDEZ
Associate Producer. What's the
name of the last film you worked
on?
J STAFFORD
Uh... High and Dry.
MENDEZ
Who paid for the movie?
J STAFFORD
C.F.D.C.
MENDEZ
What's your middle name?
J Stafford is silent. He looks down to consult the
paper in front of him, but before he can, Mendez pulls
the paper.
MENDEZ
He's an American spy. Shoot him.
A beat on Stafford, frustrated --
MENDEZ
They'll try to break you by
getting you agitated. You need to
know your rsum so well that you
don't flinch.
J STAFFORD
(nearly defeated,
LOOKING AWAY)
You think your little story will
matter when there's guns to our
heads?
MENDEZ
My story's the only thing between
you and the gun to your head.
A beat. Mendez puts the rsum back in front of
Stafford. Kathy looks at her husband: he just isn't
good at this.
(CONTINUED)
ARGO - Final 89.
224B CONTINUED: (2) 224B
MENDEZ
Let's go again.
O'Donnell, walking toward his office. It's the first
time today Malinov has seen him.
MALINOV
(GOOD NEWS)
They made it through the location
scout.
O'Donnell ignores him. He gs straight to his office.
Looking like he's seen a ghost.
OFFICE - CROSS-CUTTING - NIGHT
Mendez picks up the complicated-looking satellite phone
in Ken Taylor's home office. As soon as he ds --
O'DONNELL
Go to black on green.
Jack's calling him here, so he knows something's wrong.
MENDEZ
What is it?
O'DONNELL
Go to black on green.
Mendez turns knobs on the satellite phone.
We see Jack is on a GREEN PHONE.
(CONTINUED)
ARGO - Final 90.
224F CONTINUED: 224F
O'DONNELL
It all just changed. They called
the game. You've got to come
back.
ON Mendez, not believing what he's hearing.
O'DONNELL
(quiet, fast, clear)
Joint Chiefs are planning a
military rescue of the hostages in
a month. Delta Force started
training to storm the grounds. So
if the six of them get brought
down there, they won't be held for
long.
MENDEZ
I never would have exposed them if
I wasn't authorized to take them
out.
O'DONNELL
It's over, Tony.
MENDEZ
They will be taken. Probably not
ALIVE --
O'DONNELL
LISTEN TO ME. The thinking's
changed. Six Americans get pulled
out of a Canadian diplomat's house
and executed, it's another world
outrage. Six Americans get caught
playing movie make-believe with
the CIA at the airport and
executed, it's a national
embarrassment. They're calling
the operation.
MENDEZ
We're responsible for those
people.
O'DONNELL
(GENUINELY SAD)
What we are is required to follow
orders. I'm sorry.
Mendez hangs up. O'Donnell sits listening to the dial
tone for a moment, then puts the phone on the receiver.
(CONTINUED)
ARGO - Final 91.
224F CONTINUED: (2) 224F
Then, very suddenly, he looks at an old coffee cup near
him and backhands it off his desk.
TIME CUT TO:
OFFICE - NIGHT
Maybe only a minute, maybe ten or more have passed.
Mendez sits at Taylor's desk, numb. Cora Lijek knocks
but dsn't get a response. She tentatively opens the
door and sticks her head inside.
CORA LIJEK
We're ready to try again.
MENDEZ
(after a beat)
I think the most important thing
you can do to be ready for
tomorrow is rest.
TIME CUT TO:
NIGHT
Now the mood among the Houseguests is lighter. Bob
Anders, a handful of liquor bottles in his arms, puts
them down on a table. Music plays on a record player.
BOB ANDERS
Scorched earth policy tonight.
Nothing gets left.
Taylor comes in, drink in hand, thoughts heavy, looks at
Tony.
MENDEZ
So you know.
TAYLOR
(NODS)
ExtAff wants you to burn the
passports before you leave.
Mendez looks at the Houseguests, setting the table.
TAYLOR
If we tell them, they'll panic.
It's better if you just don't
show.

TAYLOR (CONT'D)
It was always a fucked mission.
You came closer than anybody else.
Kathy and Cora are cracking each other up.
No one sees Mendez take a bottle of Macallan from the
table and put it in his bag.
Mendez drives through nighttime Tehran, back to the
hotel.
There is a dangling TOTEM from the rearview mirror. It
reflects light.
He passes a VAN ON FIRE.
227 OMITTED 227
Mendez takes the bottle of Macallan from his bag. He
takes a drink, then drinks more.
229 OMITTED 229
Chambers, listening on a phone, shakes his head at
Siegel. He hangs up.
CHAMBERS
It's off. They want us to pack up
the office.
A beat on Lester. He's devastated but he's not showing
it.
SIEGEL
They can wait. Let's go get a
drink.
The Houseguests, getting dressed. Suiting up for the
airport.
Ken Taylor watches in the hall.
Mendez -- who looks like he hasn't slept -- sits at a
table, looking out the window.
Lee Schatz puts his Infant of Prague holy card into an
Argo script. Packs the script.
Cora Lijek is sitting next to her husband.
Kathy Stafford looks at the clock.
KATHY STAFFORD
(to J Stafford)
He's late.
O'Donnell is packing up for the night. Paper towels sit
on top of the coffee spill on his rug.
His phone rings. He picks up.
O'DONNELL
Yeah.
ARGO - Final 94.
MENDEZ
Somebody is responsible for things
when things happen, Jack. I am
responsible.
(A BEAT)
I'm taking them through.
And before Jack can answer, Tony hangs up. Stands. A
duffel bag over his shoulder, Tony turns out the light in
the hotel room. Gs.
O'Donnell, thinking. Looking at the phone. Then, with a
sudden decision, he gets up.
Rushing out of his office, into --
-- where he catches ALAN SOSA, 50s, head of the
Directorate of Support -- the CIA's chief financial
officer -- leaving for the night.
O'DONNELL
We need to confirm those seven
tickets out of Tehran on
SWISSAIR --
SOSA
N.E. shut that down.
O'DONNELL
I'm saying it's back on!
SOSA
I can't do it. It's backstopped
pending Executive Branch GO.
O'DONNELL
What the fuck ds that mean?
SOSA
Carter's got to say yes for us to
get the tickets.
Pat Taylor comes to answer an insistent knocking on her
front door. She opens it.
(CONTINUED)
ARGO - Final 95.
240 CONTINUED: 240
She's shocked to see him. Ken Taylor now appears behind
Pat. In the hall behind him: The Houseguests are
assembled, waiting to go. They look their parts -- or,
much more so than they did on the scout. Cora Lijek has
darker hair. The Staffords look on, fully dressed.
O'DONNELL
Where's Engell?
SECRETARY
He's in a meeting.
O'DONNELL
Pull him out.
(as she hesitates)
PULL HIM OUT!
Pat Taylor is embracing the Houseguests, saying goodbye.
PAT TAYLOR
Sahar's on a bus.
MENDEZ
Good. And you two leave right
now.
Ken Taylor nods. Mendez shakes his hand.
Mendez gets into the driver's seat. Lee Schatz on the
passenger side.
We see Ken's black embassy sedan waiting, driven by a
PAKISTANI DRIVER.
Mendez pulls away.
Ken Taylor watches a SGT. CLAUDE GAUTHIER, 30s, Canadian
military policeman, use a sledgehammer to SMASH
EVERYTHING IN THE OFFICE TO PIECES.
Pat Taylor comes to the door. She's holding a suitcase.

O'DONNELL
(INTERRUPTING)
I'm not leaving him at the airport

his hand. Tell the Director to
call the White House. DO YOUR
FUCKING JOB.
Engell just stares O'Donnell down.
The van speeds down the hills of the Shemiran district.
MENDEZ (V.O.)
The first checkpoint is just to
look at your passport.
Mendez is sitting in the living room instructing the
Houseguests.

O'Donnell, charging in --
O'DONNELL
Where's the Director?
MALINOV
He's on the plane.
O'DONNELL
Find White House Chief of Staff.
MALINOV
How would I find him?
O'DONNELL
We're a fucking SPY AGENCY! FIND

MENDEZ
The second checkpoint --
MALINOV
Jordan's in the West Wing. He's
not taking calls.
A beat on O'Donnell.
O'DONNELL

LAMONT

He gives out yellow immigration forms to the Houseguests.

ARGO - Final 98.
250 CONTINUED: 250
MENDEZ
The second is immigration. You'll
hand them these. They say you
landed two days ago.
Cora Lijek fingers her yellow immigration form in one
hand, holds Mark's hand with the other.
MENDEZ (V.O.)
These guys are bureaucrats left
over from the shah. They can't be
bothered to second-guess you.
Malinov slams a phone down.
MALINOV
Pace Academy in Buckhead, Georgia!
O'Donnell dials a number.
O'DONNELL
Yes, it's Mr. Murphy calling from
Pace Academy for Mr. Jordan... I'm
afraid it IS an emergency...
WHITE HOUSE OPERATOR
Hold just a moment.
She plugs a wire into an old-fashioned Ma Bell
switchboard.
MENDEZ (V.O.)
Third checkpoint is the trap.
The van pulls up to the airport. We see THRONGS of
people trying to get in -- so they can get out.
Tony pulls the car to a semi-open place and tries not to
run anyone over.
ARGO - Final 99.
MENDEZ
It's manned by Revolutionaries.
Most of them were educated in the
U.S. or Europe.
BOB ANDERS
Or Canada?
MENDEZ
They know how many T's are in
Toronto.
Jordan is in a meeting with two staffers, his feet up on
the desk. His secretary opens the door without knocking,
hurries to Jordan, whispers something in his ear. He
immediately grabs the phone.
JORDAN
Hello?
O'DONNELL (V.O.)
Jack O'Donnell from C.I.
JORDAN
Wait -- WHO -- ?
O'DONNELL (V.O.)
Tehran Houseguest operation is

KHALKALI, the fiery guy who came to the residence, along
with two YOUNG KOMITEH compare (one who delivered the
pictures): on one side, copies of re-assembled
diplomatic photographs of Americans from the embassy --
like the ones of the Houseguests we saw early in the film
-- and, on the other side, the candid photographs from
the bazaar.

Mendez's and the Houseguests' passports sit on the
counter.
SWISSAIR REP
I'm sorry, sir. I don't have
those reservations...
SWISSAIR REP looks at some green text on her screen, hits
another button.
SWISSAIR REP
My apologies. They just came

She hits another button and tickets start to print.
MALINOV

Swissair says they've picked up

260 CONTINUED: 260
MALINOV
We told them to shut that down!
He RUNS toward a phone --
The PASSPORT OFFICIAL is looking at the Canadian
passports of the six and waving them through. Mendez has
already passed. Everyone except Kathy Stafford.
The Passport Official looks at Kathy, who is doing her
best to look friendly and casual. Then he looks at
Kathy's passport, in which she looks stern and angry.
Kathy Stafford smoothes down her hair, frowns like she
ds in the passport photo. The Passport Official half
smiles and waves her through. They've all cleared the
first checkpoint.
Khalkali comes upon a diplomatic photograph of a man with
glasses.
He starts to leaf through the photographs from the
bazaar.
QUICK CUT TO:
KHALKALI --
looks at the black and white still of Mark Lijek,

we saw of Mark toward the beginning of the film. MATCH.
Khalkali stands up. SHOUTS in Farsi to another Komiteh --
ARGO - Final 102.
Bob Anders stands in front of a rough-voiced IMMIGRATION
OFFICER. He's holding Bob Anders' YELLOW IMMIGRATION
FORM and leafing through a file of hundreds of WHITE
IMMIGRATION FORMS, the duplicates. Without success.
IMMIGRATION OFFICER #2
(in Farsi; to Officer
#1, re: his own
WHITE PILE)
Nothing.
IMMIGRATION OFFICER
(to Bob Anders)
When did you say you arrived in
Iran?
BOB ANDERS
Two days ago.
IMMIGRATION OFFICER
What was the purpose of your
visit?
BOB ANDERS
We were looking at locations to
make a film. I'm the director.
Immigration Officer pauses and looks up. Looks at the
six other faces. He looks every bit as confrontational
as Tony acted in rehearsal.
BOB ANDERS
(VERY CALM)
We have a letter from the Minister
of Culture ...
The Immigration Officer gestures for the letter. Bob
takes the letter inviting them on their location scout
out of a folder. Tony, barely perceptibly, nods.
Khalkali is now speaking with MORADI, an older Komiteh
official. They speak Farsi and it's untranslated, but we
get it. He is showing the photograph of Mark Lijek from
the bazaar and comparing it to the U.S. diplomatic
photograph.
Moradi picks up the phone as Khalkali heads out.
ARGO - Final 103.
Immigration Officer is conferring with Immigration
Officer #2 as they look at the letter from the Minister
of Culture. The Houseguests and Mendez wait.
Finally, Immigration Officer #2 shrugs.
IMMIGRATION OFFICER
Okay -- Yes -- Okay --
He waves them through. Second checkpoint done.
Malinov, a phone to his ear. Ringing.
MALINOV
C'mon c'mon c'mon --
The phone in the office rings. No one is there.
ANNOUNCEMENT (V.O.)
Swissair announces general
boarding for Flight 363 to Zurich.
Passengers, mostly European businessmen, get up and
approach the gate.
ARGO - Final 104.
Mendez checks in with the Houseguests with his eyes.
They are now in sight of the airport gates. And here are
six Komiteh. Young men -- none more than 33 or so --
holding automatic weapons.
They have created their own checkpoint. It looks recent,
A SCREENED-OFF AREA WITH TABLES.
KOMITEH #1
Passports.
He looks at the Canadian passports and then almost
immediately speaks.
KOMITEH #1
You come.
He directs Mendez and the Houseguests into the screened-
off area. Speaks in Farsi to another Komiteh.
LAMONT
(holding the phone)
Purser's telling Swissair they're
not on the plane.
O'DONNELL
They should have boarded already.
MALINOV

Still no answer in L.A.
MARK LIJEK

Mark mimes turning the rotor of a movie camera. Komiteh
#1 dsn't understand.
AZIZI (O.S.)
Sit down.
A young man with a beard -- AZIZI, late 20s -- arriving
on the scene, speaking in Farsi to the others and then in
very good American English. He looks at the six and the
face he singles out is J Stafford's.

We did. We were preparing to make
a movie here, sir.
AZIZI
(FARSI)
You don't have journalist visas.
J STAFFORD

Not a documentary. A movie.
J Stafford reaches into his pocket and gives Azizi a
copy of the Argo Variety ad.
J STAFFORD
(FARSI)
You see?
(to Mendez; English)
Kevin, where's your briefcase?
A beat on Mendez. Who then opens his accordion folder
and takes from it the ARGO STORYBOARDS. J Stafford
spreads them out on the table.
Three other Komiteh in the room lean forward, their
AUTOMATIC WEAPONS at their sides, and look at the
STORYBOARD DRAWINGS. The Persian Empire futurism of Jack
Kirby's drawings.
J STAFFORD
(FARSI)
These are the villains. Y'see
these guys here? And these are
the hers... in the spice
market...
J Stafford points at the various drawings. He speaks
with an ease and confidence that we didn't know he had.

like teenagers around a comic book.
Azizi says something to another Komiteh in the room.

You don't go until we verify.
MENDEZ

Mendez hands Azizi his card. STUDIO SIX FILMS. Kevin
Harkins. A 213 (818 wasn't around yet) phone number.
ANGLES ON THE HOUSEGUESTS

young Komiteh barely look up from the drawings --
Azizi, who apparently has some authority here, enters,
telling another Komiteh in Farsi to get off the phone.

Azizi looks at the Studio Six business card and picks up
the receiver.
Azizi dials the long international number. And it is a
DIAL, so this takes a long time.
One of the young Komiteh is loudly debating with another
Komiteh the air-worthiness of a futuristic desert glider
in the storyboards. He's miming the thing crashing.
J Stafford and the Houseguests are silent. Mendez can
see the line of passengers on their Swissair flight
dwindling.
Azizi rings the phone three times -- four times -- he's
going to hang up --

Swissair announces final boarding
of Flight 363 to Zurich. All
passengers should be at the gate

Azizi comes back into the screened-off area. Looks at
J Stafford, then at Mendez. Then says something in
Farsi to the three Komiteh in the holding area. Then he
leaves.
The three young Komiteh look at the drawings, then at J
Stafford. Silence for a moment.
MENDEZ

STORYBOARDS TOWARD

Our gift to you. From our film.
Komiteh #1, who speaks enough English to understand,
translates to the others. They forget their
revolutionary mission for a second, happy with their
gift. They'd high-five if they could. They're kids.
Komiteh #1 motions for the Houseguests to go.
ARGO - Final 109.
Khalkali and a dozen Komiteh, guns drawn, rush into the
residence. Empty liquor bottles. The remains of what
looks like breakfast for a group of people.
But the place is empty.
A BUSLOAD of passengers about to be ferried to the
airplane.
A Swissair Rep is closing the gate to Flight 363. She
looks up to see the Houseguests and Mendez hurrying
through the terminal, headed toward her. She holds the
gate, speaks in German into a walkie, and --

The Komiteh search the house. Khalkali gets on the
phone.

Kathy Stafford's ticket is taken and she walks through
the door. Hurries toward the transport bus. The other
five Houseguests and Mendez behind her and --
A phone rings and a Young Komiteh picks up the call. He
listens for a moment. Then he drops the phone and RUNS
into the airport terminal and --
The Houseguests sit aboard the bus, headed to a waiting
DC-10.
The DRIVER puts the bus into gear. It dsn't go. He
shakes his head. This goddamn thing. Shifts gears
again. Now it gs.
ARGO - Final 110.
Young Komiteh RUNNING through the terminal, pushing
through a crowd, making a woman drop her suitcase,
contents scattering. An automatic weapon at his side.
Azizi and the three Komiteh from the third checkpoint
stand up from the table with the Argo storyboards. Young
Komiteh shouts at them and they take up their weapons and
join him, running --
Azizi and the three Komiteh arrive at Flight 363's gate.
The door is CLOSED.
The Houseguests put their carry-on luggage into the
overhead bins. A FLIGHT ATTENDANT is already holding a
detached seatbelt preparing to do her safety mime.
PILOT (V.O.)
(GERMAN-ACCENTED

Ladies and gentlemen, from the
flight-deck. We're looking at a
brief delay --
Passengers groan a bit as they read paperbacks or
International Herald Tribunes. Mark Lijek's arm is
around Cora. Lee Schatz is moving his mouth in what
looks like a prayer. Kathy Stafford's fingers shake as
she holds an arm rest. J Stafford tries to stay her
hand.
Mendez is sitting looking out the window toward the
terminal.
Azizi yells to the Swissair Rep, dragging her back toward
the gate. We can't hear what she says back, but she's
shaking her head.
ARGO - Final 111.
From the window, we can see a GROUND CREWMAN give a
thumbs-up. The scrubbed Swiss PILOT, 50s, gives a thumbs-
up back.
He gently releases the throttle lever.
Mendez and the Houseguests feel the plane start to move.
Azizi gs to the WINDOW. He can see the Swissair plane
slowly backing onto the runway.
He picks up a walkie and pushes through the flight gate
door, setting off an alarm, followed by the three other
Komiteh.
He reaches the METAL BARS outside and can't get past.
He CALLS INTO THE WALKIE.
An Iranian FLIGHT TRAFFIC CONTROLLER calmly speaks into

Anders high-fives Lee Schatz, then the other Houseguests.
Mark Lijek, crying, embraces Cora.
Kathy Stafford is laughing. She kisses her husband's
hand.
Some of the other passengers look up from their
newspapers, annoyed at this Canadian fuss.
All eyes watch Malinov, listening, headphone to one
ear...
MALINOV
They're CLEAR!
Cheers in the Pit. O'Donnell embraces Malinov.
Siegel throws down a phone and rushes outside... to where
Chambers smokes.
SIEGEL
OUUUT! THEY'RE OUT!
Chambers and Lester scream like kids who've just scored
the game-winning touchdown. The P.A. tries to shush
them.
A mini-champagne bottle pops. The Houseguests are
celebrating: New Year's Eve and a Super Bowl victory
party in a DC-10 aisle.
FIND Mendez, sitting alone, apart from the celebration.
Looking out the window. Mendez turns to see that someone
is standing in the aisle next to him. J Stafford.
Tony looks up at J.

FLIGHT ATTENDANT (O.S.)
I'm sorry, sir. You need to sit
down.
But J dsn't pay attention to the Flight Attendant.
He extends his hand to Mendez. Who takes it. A moment
between them.
FLIGHT ATTENDANT
Sir?
J gs back to his seat.
HOLD ON Tony Mendez.
Drinking straight from a bottle of Beefeater.
SIEGEL
It's history, is what it is.
History plays out first as farce,
then as tragedy.'
CHAMBERS
The quote's the other way around.
SIEGEL
Who said it?
CHAMBERS
Marx.
SIEGEL
Groucho?
CHAMBERS
Karl.
The celebration is quieter and drunker now.
LAMONT
(a couple of beers
ALONG)
We are the good guys!
ROSSI LAMONT
Six down, fifty to go. Call the Times, nail it to
the fucking door. The CIA
are the good guys.
MALINOV
The Canadians are the good guys.
LAMONT
-- we're not greedy -- them too --
MALINOV
Only. Canada takes the credit, or
they'll retaliate against the
hostages. Great Satan wasn't
involved. No CIA.
LAMONT
Is that right, Jack?
O'DONNELL
Involved in what? We're as
surprised as anybody. Thank you,
Canada.
Jack raises a glass of Scotch and takes a drink.

Mendez stands at a desk on the main floor.
MENDEZ
Wha'd you say to her?
And suddenly it's dead-quiet. We're in a vault inside a
vault in the basement of the main building.
Mendez's suitcase is laying on a low counter, an ARCHIVES
OFFICER t-tagging and cataloging various items.
Separating Mendez's personal things from material related
to the operation.
Mendez empties his briefcase and the officer puts a
sticker on the VARIETY featuring the ARGO ad. Another on
the ARGO script. He's putting things into a box that
reads: USCIA CLASSIFIED MATERIAL.
Mendez opens his accordion folder -- flips through it --
it's empty -- no. There's something inside.
In one of the compartments is a STORYBOARD FROM ARGO.
One that the Komiteh missed. While the Archives Officer
is turned around, Mendez slips the storyboard back into
the accordion folder and puts it back with his personal
things.

A scene of the Old West on a television.
