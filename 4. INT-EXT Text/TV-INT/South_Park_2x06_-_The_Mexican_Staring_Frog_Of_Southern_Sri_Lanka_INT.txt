               A TITLE comes up; 'HUNTIN' and KILLIN' with Jimbo and Ned'.

                                     NARRATOR
                         And now back to Huntin' and Killin' 
                         with South Park's favorite hunters 
                         Jimbo and Ned!


               Mr. Garrison walks over to the chalkboard and writes 'Vietnam' 
               in big letters.

               Cartman raises his hand.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Mr. Garrison, what's Vietnam?

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         What's Vietnam... A question a child 
                         might ask, but not a childish 
                         question...

               Garrison laughs. Stan and Kyle look at each other, confused.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Children, for the next few days we'll 
                         be learning all about Vietnam. Chances 
                         are that somebody in YOUR OWN LIVES 
                         was affected by this incredible war.

                                     MR. HAT
                         That's right, Mr. Garrison. The 
                         Vietnam war was sticky and icky.

               Kyle raises his hand.

                                     KYLE
                         Mr. Garrison... Were YOU in Vietnam?

               Garrison gets a very serious look. ZOOM IN to his head, and 
               the sounds of guns, screaming and helicopters echo in his 
               mind. This is all done with archive footage of Vietnam.

               The kids all watch, perplexed.

               Garrison is in a trance, as the screaming and helicopter 
               sounds get louder and louder.

                                     VOICE
                         Who's next to take a shower? Ooo! 
                         Me!!!

               Suddenly, the sounds all come to a halt. Garrison snaps out 
               of his trance, smiling.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                              (matter-of-fact)
                         No, I wasn't in Vietnam. But sometimes 
                         I like to pretend I was.
                              (pause)
                         Anyway, children, I'm going to assign 
                         you all a paper.

               The kids all moan.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         I want you all to find somebody in 
                         your own life who was in Vietnam, 
                         and interview them about it.

                                     CLYDE
                         What if we don't know anybody who 
                         was in Vietnam?

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Then you get an F, fail the third 
                         grade, and have to get a job cleaning 
                         septic tanks to support your drug 
                         habit.

                                     CLYDE
                         Oh.

               Stan turns to Kyle.

                                     STAN
                         Dude, my uncle Jimbo was in Vietnam!

                                     KYLE
                         Hey, yeah. He and Ned do that stupid 
                         TV show.


                                     JIMBO
                         And now, time for Jimbo's mysteries 
                         of the unexplained. One of our loyal 
                         viewers from South Park sent us some 
                         eight millimeter film of what HE 
                         claims to be... The Mexican Staring 
                         Frog of Southern Sri Lanka!

               A video still picture of an artists' rendition of the frog.

                                     JIMBO
                         Now as you all know, the Mexican 
                         staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka 
                         can supposedly kill you with one 
                         horrid gaze. If a person even so 
                         much as looks into the frogs eyes, 
                         they can be paralyzed or even die! 
                         And this film proves that the frog 
                         may very well exist!

               The film begins.


               Ned and Jimbo are up in a helicopter.

                                     JIMBO (V.O.)
                         Soon, it was all on just me and Ned 
                         to win the war for America.

               Jimbo is piloting.

                                     JIMBO
                         Pass me some more cocoa, will you 
                         Ned?

                                     NED
                         Certainly. And would you like another 
                         muffin as well?

                                     JIMBO
                         Why the hell not, we're at war.

               Ned lights up yet another cigarette.

                                     JIMBO
                         Hey you know those things are bad 
                         for your throat.

                                     NED
                         No, that's all lies. I'll be fine. 
                         CHARLIES AT TWO O' CLOCK!!

               Down on the ground, THOUSANDS of Vietnamese scurry like ants.

                                     JIMBO
                         I see 'em! Drop the bomb!

                                     NED
                         THE BOMB'S NOT RELEASING!!

                                     JIMBO
                         Oh no!

                                     NED
                         It won't budge!!

                                     JIMBO
                         Then we have only one option...

               Jimbo points the chopper downward and zooms towards the 
               ground.

                                     NED
                         What are you doing, man?

                                     JIMBO
                         We have to take 'em out Ned! At all 
                         costs!! Die you red commie bastards!!!

               The chopper hurls towards the Vietnamese. Ned grabs Jimbo's 
               hand as death flies towards them. CRASH!!! The chopper slams 
               into a bunch of Vietnamese Soldiers.

               Jimbo and Ned jump out from the wreckage, shooting in all 
               directions. Vietnamese die all over the place. Finally, Ned 
               is out of bullets. He pulls out a grenade, pulls the pin and 
               BAM!! It takes Ned's arm right off.

                                     NED
                         YAAGHGH!!!

               Jimbo empties his gun.

                                     JIMBO
                         Oh, no! Out of ammo!

               He draws a large elegant sword, then spots a mighty white 
               stallion.

               Ned, meanwhile, uses martial arts expertly to fend off his 
               Vietnamese attackers. Jimbo jumps onto the white steed and 
               starts chopping up victims with his sword. Ned is like Chuck 
               Norris.

               Finally, all the Vietnamese lie dead.

                                     JIMBO
                         WE DID IT, NED! WE KILLED THE ENTIRE 
                         VIETCONG ARMY!

               Ned looks over the horizon, where he see thousands of dead 
               bodies.

                                     NED
                         Whoopee!

               Ned lights a smoke.

                                     JIMBO
                         Let's get back to base camp! We can 
                         ride the log ride before it closes!

               Ned jumps on the back of the horse and the two ride off into 
               the sunset.


               Stan, Kyle, Kenny, and Cartman are up in front of the class. 
               Stan reads from notecards.

                                     STAN
                         ...and after killing the entire 
                         Vietcong army, they returned to base 
                         camp. Once there, they rode the 
                         Devil's drop roller coaster and ate 
                         Cotton Candy. And ultimately, Ned 
                         got the purple heart for his 
                         courageous defense of the log ride.

               Garrison rolls his eyes.

                                     STAN
                         So was the horror of Vietnam. The 
                         end.

                                     BOYS
                         The end.

                                     KYLE
                         Are there any questions?

               Garrison raises his hand.

                                     KYLE
                         Yes Mr. Garrison?

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Yes, where in the fuck did you hear 
                         this ridiculous load of bullshit?

                                     STAN
                         From Vietnam veterans.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Well boys, its obvious to me that 
                         you didn't do your work, and then 
                         you stayed up all night making up 
                         some ridiculous lie.

                                     STAN
                         No, no we didn't.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         You all receive an F. MINUS.

                                     KYLE
                         F minus? Can he do that?

                                     STAN
                              (shocked)
                         But we're not making it up...

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Stanly, the Vietnam war was a WAR! 
                         There weren't galloping steeds or 
                         singing birds or log rides.

                                     KYLE
                         How do you know? You weren't even 
                         there.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Well that's it! All of you have 
                         detention for the rest of the week.

                                     BOYS
                         AWW!!

               FIRST COMMERCIAL BREAK.

                                          ACT II


               Mr. Mackey sits at the front of the room with a big sign 
               that says "DETENTION: QUIET!!!!!" The boys sit with their 
               hands crossed and talk in a whisper.

                                     MR. MACKEY
                         Welcome to detention, Mkay? Mr. 
                         Garrison told me about your little 
                         joke. It is important for you to 
                         know WHY you are in detention for 
                         you to obtain the full benefits from 
                         it. You are here because you are 
                         inferior, okay? You are here because 
                         you are awkward, okay?...

               Mr. Mackey continues.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Well Stan, thanks a lot for having 
                         such a cool uncle that got us all 
                         detention for a week.

                                     KYLE
                         Yeah dude, your uncle Jimbo sucks 
                         ass!

                                     MACKEY
                         Ssshh, okay?!

               Mackey shushes the boys. They wait a beat.

                                     STAN
                         Why would he just invent a story 
                         instead of just telling us the truth?

                                     CARTMAN
                         Well, let's see maybe 'cuz he's an 
                         old drunk hillbilly dick!

                                     MACKEY
                         SSSSHH, okay?!

                                     KYLE
                         We got to get him back dude.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Totally.

                         How?

                                     KYLE
                         Well, he screwed us by making 
                         something up... I say we do the same 
                         thing.

                                     STAN
                         Well, what do you mean?

                         Did you ever see that one Brady Bunch 
                         where the guy...

                         Oh yeah sweet, sweet!

               The boys all lean in to hear Kyle's whispering.

                         And now back to 'Huntin' and Killin'' 
                         with South Park's favorite hunters -- 
                         Jimbo and Ned!


               The boys are all on the couch watching the show.

                                     KYLE
                         Dude! I can't believe they fell for 
                         it!

                                     STAN
                         Yeah what a couple of dumbasses!

                         Mph rmph rm rmph rmph rm!

               The boys all laugh.

                                     STAN
                         Yeah!

                                     KYLE
                         Come on, we gotta go make another 
                         one!

               The boys all head out the door.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Lying kicks ass!

                                     JESUS
                         Yeah?

               Jesus is getting his face powdered.

                                     PRODUCER
                         We're in trouble. The Jimbo and Ned 
                         show made up some ridiculous staring 
                         frog story and jumped another two 
                         points in the ratings!

                                     JESUS
                         Oh, oh. So what are we supposed to 
                         do?

                                     PRODUCER
                         I don't know. We'll have to continue 
                         with the changes we've made, and 
                         then go even further...

               Riki lake music starts as the Jesus and Pals logo glides 
               past the frame.

               Jesus is in the audience a la Riki.

                                     JESUS
                         If you're just joining us, we've 
                         been listening to Michelle's 
                         incredible story of survival. Go on, 
                         Michelle.

                                     WOMAN GUEST
                              (in tears)
                         Well, as I was saying, I tried and 
                         tried but the overturned car just 
                         wouldn't budge. My husband was trapped 
                         for twelve hours.

                                     JESUS
                         And yet somehow he managed to survive.

                                     WOMAN GUEST
                         That's right. He's a very brave man 
                         and I love him very much.

               The man guest smiles at the woman. His head is flat like a 
               pancake and his arm sticks out of his back.

                                     MAN GUEST
                         I mov oo too.

                                     JESUS
                         Well, let's see if the audience has 
                         any questions.
                              (beat)
                         Yes, you over there --

               Jesus trots over to a large ugly woman.

                                     WOMAN
                         I think she needs to kick him to the 
                         curb, baby!

               Jesus looks confused.

                                     JESUS
                         Kick WHO to the curb?

                                     WOMAN
                         Her no good husband!! She's gotta 
                         lose that zero and get herself a 
                         hero!!!

               The crowd goes wild.

                                     JESUS
                         But --

               Another woman stands up next to her.

                                     WOMAN 2
                         He wants to have his cake and eat it 
                         too! He's gotta dump that trash, 
                         girlfriend! It's all about respect! 
                         You gotta have respect for yourSELF!

               The woman guest looks extremely confused.

                                     JESUS
                         Uh... I think we've somewhat missed 
                         the point here, let's go to somebody 
                         else...

               Jesus goes to another audience member.

                                     JESUS
                         Yes, your comments?

                                     BLACK MAN
                         Montel, I think we're forgetting 
                         something very important in all of 
                         this. Okay, sure he touched some 
                         children, but the man is a great 
                         singer and he has entertained us for 
                         so many years.

                                     JESUS
                         What are you talking about?

                                     BLACK MAN
                         Michael Jackson. All this bad mouthing 
                         and putting the man down. Maybe he 
                         did touch some children now and then, 
                         but come on! It's Michael Jackson. 
                         Michael Jackson!

               People applaud. Jesus pulls the mic away from the man.

                                     JESUS
                         Uh... We'll be back right after these 
                         messages...


               Jesus' producer is watching the Jimbo and Ned on her monitors, 
               her head falls into her hands.

                                     PRODUCER
                         Oh no, no, no! This is the biggest 
                         publicity stunt I've ever seen. Damn 
                         those hunters are clever!

                                     JESUS
                         Uh... Clever?

                                     PRODUCER
                         It's genius, it really is. Hell, I 
                         even want to watch them hunt the 
                         Mexican Staring Frog! Unless...

                                     JESUS
                         Unless what?

                                     PRODUCER
                         Unless we can prove to the world 
                         that the whole thing is a sham. If 
                         we prove that the Mexican Staring 
                         Frog of Southern Sri Lanka is just 
                         something made up by Jimbo and Ned, 
                         we can have them taken off the air. 
                         Perhaps even KILLED!

                                     JESUS
                         Look, why don't we stick to our own 
                         show. People will watch again.

                                     PRODUCER
                         Oh J... You are so Omnipotent and 
                         yet so naïve... We'll launch a full 
                         investigation. And in the meantime 
                         we can cash in on the video tapes.

                                     JESUS
                         What video tapes?


               Jesus is sitting at his chair.

                                     JESUS
                         Yea, my children. I am the way and 
                         the light. Let's get to our next 
                         guest...

               As Jesus continues, a loud voice over begins.

                                     NARRATOR
                         You've seen Jesus and Pals... Now

                         and Pals too hot for TV!

               bars cover their chests.

               A number and address to call appears on the screen. The 
               commercial ends.

                                         ACT III


               Jimbo is sitting beside Ned's bed reading a book. Ned is 
               still catatonic. The Producer is standing off to the side.

                                     JIMBO
                              (reading)
                         But Pony Boy was beat up pretty bad. 
                         He kept saying 'Stay Gold'.

               Jimbo closes the book.

                                     JIMBO
                         Aw, Ned... If you can hear me... You 
                         gotta snap out of it. 'Cause if you 
                         don't, I'll never forgive myself.

               Ned is still catatonic.

               The boys walk in to find Jimbo drying his tears.

                                     JIMBO
                         Oh, Stanly! He's gone! My only friend 
                         in the world is gone!

                                     STAN
                         Dude! He's okay! That frog wasn't 
                         even real! Look --

               Stan holds up another plastic frog.

                                     JIMBO
                         AGH!! What the hell are you doing?! 
                         I almost looked right at that!!

                                     STAN
                         Dude, it's just a plastic frog. It's 
                         not real. Check it out --

               He hands the frog to Jimbo. Jimbo examines it.

                                     JIMBO
                         ...What?

                                     STAN
                         We shot all those videos and sent 
                         them in.

                                     KYLE
                         Yeah, we made the whole thing up. It 
                         was all just a really really funny 
                         joke.

                                     JIMBO
                         You sent in those videos?!!!!

                                     PRODUCER
                         Oh, this is not good.

                                     JIMBO
                         My best friend is a vegetable and 
                         I'm going to be the laughing stock 
                         of South Park!

                                     KYLE
                         Aw come on! Ned's faking it! That 
                         frog was just a piece of plastic.

                                     STAN
                         Yeah, come on Ned, quit faking!

                                     JIMBO
                         You boys don't understand. Ned was 
                         so freaked out by the idea of the 
                         Mexican Staring Frog that he must 
                         have sent himself into a deep coma!

               Stan and Kyle look at each other concerned.

                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                         It's a psycho-somatic response.

               We PAN over to the doorway where the Jesus and Pal's producer 
               who is standing just outside the room holding one of those 
               telescopic microphones that is used in football games.

                                     PRODUCER
                         I couldn't help overhearing your 
                         conversation just now.

               The producer walks in.

                                     KYLE
                         Who are you?

                                     PRODUCER
                         I produce a little TV show called 
                         Jesus and Pals. You might have heard 
                         of it. Your story is AMAZING! Full 
                         of jealousy, duplicity, backstabbing 
                         and bitterness!

                                     JIMBO
                         Uh... thanks?

                                     PRODUCER
                         How would you like to share your 
                         remarkable story with us on tomorrow's 
                         show?


               CHEEZY MUSIC. Lights search the crowd. Superimposed titles 
               read "Tots in Trouble!"

               Jimbo and the boys are on stage. Ned sits next to Jimbo still 
               catatonic.

                                     JESUS
                         We're back with Jimbo and his nephew 
                         Stan. These kids can't stop lying, 
                         can they?

                                     JIMBO
                         That's right Jesus. No respect for 
                         their elders. As some of you may 
                         know, I host a local show on hunting --

               A smattering of applause.

                                     JIMBO
                         Thanks. We've been hunting the Mexican 
                         Staring Frog for a week based on 
                         some video footage we received from 
                         a viewer. Well, it turns out that 
                         these kids FAKED the footage!

                                     JESUS
                         Is this true, Stan?

                                     STAN
                         It was just a joke. We didn't think 
                         it would hurt anybody.

               Jesus looks at the producer who signals for a commercial.

                                     JESUS
                         We'll find out more about this 
                         debauchery when we return!

               Music kicks in and the camera BOOMS off of Jesus.

                                     AD
                         And we're... OUT!

               Producers rush the stage.

                                     PRODUCER
                         You're corpses up here!! We need A 
                         LOT more action from everybody!

                                     JIMBO
                         Like what?

                                     PRODUCER
                         Like go ahead and tell how your nephew 
                         Stan takes drugs and worships Satan.

                                     JIMBO
                         Satan. Got it.

                                     STAN
                         Whoa, I don't take drugs and worship 
                         Satan! That's lying!

                                     JIMBO
                         Give you a taste of your own medicine 
                         you little fibber!

                                     PRODUCER
                         And you kids! I didn't bring you on 
                         this show to be boring! Somebody get 
                         pissed and throw a chair at Ned here.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Dibs!

                                     PRODUCER
                         Remember, you all start to fight 
                         after the chair is thrown. That's 
                         your cue!

                                     JIMBO
                         Righty.

               Music kicks in. The audience goes wild.

                                     JESUS
                         Welcome back to Jesus and Pals! Jimbo, 
                         why do you think little Stanly lies?

                                     JIMBO
                         I'll tell you why... Because he's on 
                         drugs and he worships the devil!!!

               The crowd GASPS! Stan sits in shock.

                                     AUDIENCE
                         JESUS!!! JESUS!!!! JESUS!!!

                                     JESUS
                         Wow. Now Stanly, it sounds like your 
                         uncle is really worried about you.

                                     STAN
                         Well... I only did it because he 
                         molested me!!!

               GASP!!! Jesus' jaw drops. Two producers high-five behind the 
               camera.

                                     JIMBO
                         Why you little piece of crap!

                                     STAN
                         You big piece of crap!!

                                     CARTMAN
                         That's it, now I'm all pissed off!!!

               Cartman picks up a chair and wings it at Ned. It hits him on 
               the head but he doesn't move an inch.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Take that hippie!

                                     JIMBO
                         HEY!!!

               He picks up his chair and throws it at Stan. Stan ducks and 
               it hits a lady in the crowd.

                                     AUDIENCE
                         JESUS!!! JESUS!!!!

                                     JESUS
                         Okay, okay. That's enough!

               She dashes up and attacks Jimbo.

                                     LADY IN THE CROWD
                         TAKE THAT YOU ASSHOLE!!!

                                     LADY IN THE CROWD
                         What the fuck was that?!

                                     JESUS
                         Uh, let's watch the language people --

                                     JIMBO
                         BRING IT ON YOU BITCH!!!

                                     CARTMAN
                         HEY GET OFF OF HIM YOU FUCKIN' NUT 
                         SACK!!!

               Cartman jumps on them. The crowd jumps on the boys. A huge 
               melee ensues.

                                     KENNY
                         Mrph mrph!!

               Two angry crowd members have Kenny between them in a tug of 
               war. They tug and tug.

                                     JESUS
                         Let's all make our way back to our 
                         seats.

                                     KENNY
                         MMMMRPPH!!

               They RIP him in half, killing him instantly.

                                     STAN
                         OH MY GOD! THEY KILLED KENNY!!!

                                     KYLE
                         YOU BASTARDS!!!

                                     JESUS
                         Let's all make our way back to our 
                         seats.

               No one notices. The fights continue. Full-on chaos. The 
               dialogue is a continuous BLEEEP.

                                     JESUS
                         SHUT THE FUCK UP!!!!

               Silence. Everyone looks at Jesus.

                                     JESUS
                         Jesus, what is wrong with you people!?

               People look ashamed. Everyone disentangles themselves from 
               their respective piles.

                                     JESUS
                         Look around you Stanly. Look at all 
                         the pain and suffering your lie has 
                         caused.

                                     STAN
                         Well we only did it because Jimbo 
                         lied to us first. We had this report 
                         on the Vietnam War for school and we 
                         interviewed Jimbo about it. He made 
                         up all this stuff about Vietnam and 
                         he got us in trouble!!

                                     JIMBO
                         Hey now, everything that I told you 
                         about the war actually happened!

                                     STAN
                         Mr. Garrison said there was no way 
                         that you could have defeated the 
                         entire Viet Cong by yourself.

               The audience gets really silent.

                                     JESUS
                         The ENTIRE Vietcong army?

               Jimbo looks around nervously.

                                     JIMBO
                         I, uh... Well okay, I might have 
                         EMBELLISHED the truth a little, but 
                         that's different.

                                     JESUS
                         Is it?

                                     JIMBO
                         Well sure, I mean... well no, I guess 
                         not.

                                     JESUS
                         And as for you Stan, I think you 
                         need to kick your drug habit and --

                                     STAN
                         Wait a second, I don't take drugs! 
                         That was a lie!

                                     JESUS
                         Wait, Jimbo made that up?

                                     STAN
                         No, your producer did. She made Jimbo 
                         tell everybody that I did drugs.

               Jesus smiles drops.

                                     JESUS
                         What?!

                                     STAN
                         During the break. Your producer came 
                         over and told Jimbo what to say about 
                         me. She told him to lie!

                                     JIMBO
                         It's true, she did. I'm such a tool.

                                     JESUS
                         Oh really?

               Jesus looks over at his producer who is trying to hide behind 
               a small plant.

                                     KYLE
                         Yeah, then she told us to throw a 
                         chair at Ned!

                                     CARTMAN
                         Yeah, I didn't want to do it Jesus! 
                         They made me do it!!

               The crowd gets up and starts to bail.

                                     MAN IN THE CROWD
                         Screw this show! I thought this was 
                         all real!

               The whole crowd walks out the door, right by Jesus.

                                     JESUS
                         Wait everybody! Come back!

               But they all leave. Jesus drops the mike.

                                     BLACK MAN
                         Don't feel too bad Montel. We all 
                         want to touch children sometimes, 
                         it's only natural...

               COMMERCIAL BREAK - EPILOGUE


               The producer is horrified as she walks around the flames of 
               hell with pitchforks stabbing her ass.

                                     PRODUCER
                         WHAT IS THIS?! WHAT'S HAPPENING?!

                                     SATAN
                         Welcome to my dominion.

                                     PRODUCER
                         Aaaah...

               The producer looks confused.

                                     SADAM HUSSEIN
                         Eh, take a load off, put your feet 
                         up! Me and Satan were just aboot to 
                         go shopping for furniture. Come on 
                         Satan.

                                     SATAN
                         Okay honey.

               They walk off hand in hand.

               The producer looks up to the heavens.

                                     PRODUCER
                         NOOOOOOOOOOOoooooooooo!!!

                                         THE END
