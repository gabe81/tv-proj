               INT. T.V. SET

               A TITLE comes up; 'HUNTIN' and KILLIN' with Jimbo and Ned'.

                                     NARRATOR
                         And now back to Huntin' and Killin' 
                         with South Park's favorite hunters 
                         Jimbo and Ned!

               EXT. JIMBO AND NED'S PORCH - DAY

                                     JIMBO
                         I'm Jimbo Kern and this here is Ned. 
                         Say hi, Ned.

                                     NED
                         Hi, Ned.

                                     JIMBO
                         HAAAAA!!! HAA-HAA!!! Now isn't that 
                         great?!

               Jimbo looks to the camera guy who gives Jimbo a 'thumbs up' 
               As Jimbo talks, titles come up "Pussy Law #4: No animal shall 
               be harmed even in self defense, unless specific license and 
               season is in order. Self defense can only be justified by 
               extreme provable peril and or documented visible bodily harm.

                                     JIMBO
                         We have a terrific show for you today. 
                         We're gonna kill some Elk and we're 
                         gonna kill some Mountain Goats. Now, 
                         the new law passed by Colorado 
                         legislature, which Ned and I call 
                         pussy law number FOUR -- states that 
                         we can no longer kill animals in 
                         defense. In other words, our old 
                         line of 'It's coming right for us'

                                     NED
                         It's coming right for us.

                                     JIMBO
                         -- No longer works. So now, we only 
                         kill animals to quote: "thin out 
                         their numbers". If we don't hunt, 
                         then these animals will grow too big 
                         in number and they won't have enough 
                         food. So you see? We have to kill 
                         animals or else they'll die.

               Jimbo and Ned have to just think about this one. The camera 
               guy scratches his head.

                                     JIMBO
                         Uhh... So roll the tape.

               EXT. SOUTH PARK - FOREST - DAY

               We see a video image of Jimbo and Ned in full hunting gear.

                                     JIMBO (V.O.)
                         Here we are up at Schaeffer's 
                         Crossing, looking for some animals.

               Now we cut in to the video taped Jimbo and Ned.

                                     JIMBO
                         Lookie there, Ned! There's some 
                         deers!!

               A delicate grouping of five deer stand around eating grass.

                                     JIMBO
                         Quick, Ned! THIN OUT THEIR NUMBERS!!!

                                     NED
                         THIN OUT THEIR NUMBERS!

               Ned takes out his flame thrower and barbecues all five of 
               them. Their little deer skeletons fall to the ground.

                                     JIMBO
                         Good work, Ned! Now they won't starve!

               EXT. JIMBO AND NED'S PORCH

               Back to the set. The boys are horrified.

                                     JIMBO
                         That sure was a great hunting trip. 
                         We saved those deer from extinction.

                                     NED
                         We're environmentalists.

                                     JIMBO
                         Coming up next, were going to drop 
                         some napalm on an unsuspecting family 
                         of beavers. And also try to thin out 
                         the numbers of some endangered 
                         species.

               EXT. SOUTH PARK ELEMENTARY - DAY

               Establishing.

               INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

               Mr. Garrison walks over to the chalkboard and writes 'Vietnam' 
               in big letters.

               Cartman raises his hand.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Mr. Garrison, what's Vietnam?

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         What's Vietnam... A question a child 
                         might ask, but not a childish 
                         question...

               Garrison laughs. Stan and Kyle look at each other, confused.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Children, for the next few days we'll 
                         be learning all about Vietnam. Chances 
                         are that somebody in YOUR OWN LIVES 
                         was affected by this incredible war.

                                     MR. HAT
                         That's right, Mr. Garrison. The 
                         Vietnam war was sticky and icky.

               Kyle raises his hand.

                                     KYLE
                         Mr. Garrison... Were YOU in Vietnam?

               Garrison gets a very serious look. ZOOM IN to his head, and 
               the sounds of guns, screaming and helicopters echo in his 
               mind. This is all done with archive footage of Vietnam.

               The kids all watch, perplexed.

               Garrison is in a trance, as the screaming and helicopter 
               sounds get louder and louder.

                                     VOICE
                         Who's next to take a shower? Ooo! 
                         Me!!!

               Suddenly, the sounds all come to a halt. Garrison snaps out 
               of his trance, smiling.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                              (matter-of-fact)
                         No, I wasn't in Vietnam. But sometimes 
                         I like to pretend I was.
                              (pause)
                         Anyway, children, I'm going to assign 
                         you all a paper.

               The kids all moan.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         I want you all to find somebody in 
                         your own life who was in Vietnam, 
                         and interview them about it.

                                     CLYDE
                         What if we don't know anybody who 
                         was in Vietnam?

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Then you get an F, fail the third 
                         grade, and have to get a job cleaning 
                         septic tanks to support your drug 
                         habit.

                                     CLYDE
                         Oh.

               Stan turns to Kyle.

                                     STAN
                         Dude, my uncle Jimbo was in Vietnam!

                                     KYLE
                         Hey, yeah. He and Ned do that stupid 
                         TV show.

               INT. T.V. SET

                                     JIMBO
                         And now, time for Jimbo's mysteries 
                         of the unexplained. One of our loyal 
                         viewers from South Park sent us some 
                         eight millimeter film of what HE 
                         claims to be... The Mexican Staring 
                         Frog of Southern Sri Lanka!

               A video still picture of an artists' rendition of the frog.

                                     JIMBO
                         Now as you all know, the Mexican 
                         staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka 
                         can supposedly kill you with one 
                         horrid gaze. If a person even so 
                         much as looks into the frogs eyes, 
                         they can be paralyzed or even die! 
                         And this film proves that the frog 
                         may very well exist!

               The film begins.

               EXT. FOREST - DAY

               The camera shakes as if poorly hand-held. We see some trees.

                                     JIMBO
                         Now watch carefully, you're going to 
                         see the Mexican Staring Frog...

               After a few more seconds, a very brief, very faint blur goes 
               through the corner of the screen.

                                     JIMBO
                         THERE! THERE! DID YOU SEE IT?!?!

               EXT. JIMBO AND NED'S PORCH - DAY

                                     JIMBO
                         ROLL THAT BACK AGAIN!!

               EXT. FOREST - DAY

               The same film, again we see the blur.

                                     JIMBO
                         NOW FREEZE IT!!

               It freezes into a bigger blur.

               EXT. JIMBO AND NED'S PORCH - DAY

                                     JIMBO
                         Well, I'd like to know what all you 
                         skeptics have to say NOW!! What do 
                         you think Ned?

                                     NED
                         I'm scared.

                                     JIMBO
                         Well be sure to join us next time. 
                         Until then...
                              (singing)
                         We're so glad you spent your time 
                         with us, while we slaughtered our 
                         way through nature's guts, come again 
                         and stay a while, we'll kill a lot 
                         more living things and make them 
                         bleed.

                                     NED
                         Good night!

               The show ends.

                                     CAMERAGUY
                         And we're... CUT! Great show guys.

               Ned and Jimbo get up from their chairs and stretch.

                                     JIMBO
                         Oh, lookie who's here! My little 
                         nephew Stanly!

               The boys walk over.

                                     JIMBO
                         So, you're interested in your Uncle 
                         Jimbo's big T.V. show, huh?

                                     STAN
                         No. We have to do a stupid report on 
                         Vietnam. You and Ned are the only 
                         guys we know who were there.

                                     JIMBO
                         Oh. Yeah, we sure were.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Was it fun?

                                     KYLE
                         Cartman! What kind of stupid ass 
                         question is that?! Of course it was 
                         fun!

                                     JIMBO
                         Well, sure, Vietnam was fun. But not 
                         like going to the circus fun. Or 
                         flyfishing in Montana fun. No, Vietnam 
                         was more like shoving shards of broken 
                         glass up your ass and then sitting 
                         in a tub of Tabasco sauce fun.

                                     STAN
                         Woa.

                                     JIMBO
                         Yepper, that's where me and Ned 
                         met....

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. VIETNAM CAMP - THIRTY YEARS AGO

               PAN ACROSS a very cliché Vietnam scene. 60's music plays in 
               the background, as helicopters and troops walk around. It is 
               a scene reminiscent of Platoon. Except that as the PAN 
               continues, we see that there is also a merry-go-round, a 
               beautiful garden with flowers, and a jolly log ride.

                                     JIMBO (V.O.)
                         I remember I had just gotten off the 
                         Ferris wheel...

               A younger Jimbo walks off a big colorful Ferris Wheel in the 
               middle of Camp.

                                     JIMBO
                         Oh boy! What a gorgeous day!

               A bird flies down and lands on Jimbo's shoulder. It whistles 
               a merry tune.

               Jimbo whistles in return. (Like Snow White).

                                     SARGEANT
                         KERNS! Get over here!

               Jimbo walks over to a grouping of privates.

                                     SARGEANT
                         The new privates are here. I'm 
                         assigning one of them to you as a 
                         trainee. NED Gerblanksi!

               The privates part, and Ned steps out. He looks a little 
               different, he still has his arm and his beautiful voice.

                                     NED
                         Ned Gerblanksi reporting, sir.

                                     SARGEANT
                         Thanks Ned. The bad guys have been 
                         spotted about ten clicks north of 
                         here. I know that you and Kern are 
                         best suited to take them out. Are 
                         you up for it?

                                     JIMBO AND NED
                         Sir yes SIR!

               INT. HELICOPTER - VIETNAM

               Ned and Jimbo are up in a helicopter.

                                     JIMBO (V.O.)
                         Soon, it was all on just me and Ned 
                         to win the war for America.

               Jimbo is piloting.

                                     JIMBO
                         Pass me some more cocoa, will you 
                         Ned?

                                     NED
                         Certainly. And would you like another 
                         muffin as well?

                                     JIMBO
                         Why the hell not, we're at war.

               Ned lights up yet another cigarette.

                                     JIMBO
                         Hey you know those things are bad 
                         for your throat.

                                     NED
                         No, that's all lies. I'll be fine. 
                         CHARLIES AT TWO O' CLOCK!!

               Down on the ground, THOUSANDS of Vietnamese scurry like ants.

                                     JIMBO
                         I see 'em! Drop the bomb!

                                     NED
                         THE BOMB'S NOT RELEASING!!

                                     JIMBO
                         Oh no!

                                     NED
                         It won't budge!!

                                     JIMBO
                         Then we have only one option...

               Jimbo points the chopper downward and zooms towards the 
               ground.

                                     NED
                         What are you doing, man?

                                     JIMBO
                         We have to take 'em out Ned! At all 
                         costs!! Die you red commie bastards!!!

               The chopper hurls towards the Vietnamese. Ned grabs Jimbo's 
               hand as death flies towards them. CRASH!!! The chopper slams 
               into a bunch of Vietnamese Soldiers.

               Jimbo and Ned jump out from the wreckage, shooting in all 
               directions. Vietnamese die all over the place. Finally, Ned 
               is out of bullets. He pulls out a grenade, pulls the pin and 
               BAM!! It takes Ned's arm right off.

                                     NED
                         YAAGHGH!!!

               Jimbo empties his gun.

                                     JIMBO
                         Oh, no! Out of ammo!

               He draws a large elegant sword, then spots a mighty white 
               stallion.

               Ned, meanwhile, uses martial arts expertly to fend off his 
               Vietnamese attackers. Jimbo jumps onto the white steed and 
               starts chopping up victims with his sword. Ned is like Chuck 
               Norris.

               Finally, all the Vietnamese lie dead.

                                     JIMBO
                         WE DID IT, NED! WE KILLED THE ENTIRE 
                         VIETCONG ARMY!

               Ned looks over the horizon, where he see thousands of dead 
               bodies.

                                     NED
                         Whoopee!

               Ned lights a smoke.

                                     JIMBO
                         Let's get back to base camp! We can 
                         ride the log ride before it closes!

               Ned jumps on the back of the horse and the two ride off into 
               the sunset.

               A BAND kicks in with some funky music and spotlights circle 
               the studio. SLICK GRAPHICS spin into frame with a big WHOOSH!

               The band ends with flourish. Fireworks go off behind the 
               set. Jesus looks around a little confused.

                                     JESUS
                         Uh... hi.

               The producer motions to Jesus to keep it going.

                                     JESUS
                         Uh... yeah, okay --

               An awkward silence. LONG silence.

                         Nothing. Nothing really at all.

               Yet another long beat. The Producer makes a gesture and the 
               band starts playing 'Nothing from Nothing'. Jesus looks 
               around.

                                     JESUS

                         ...and after killing the entire 
                         Vietcong army, they returned to base 
                         camp. Once there, they rode the 
                         Devil's drop roller coaster and ate 
                         Cotton Candy. And ultimately, Ned 
                         got the purple heart for his 
                         courageous defense of the log ride.

               Mr. Mackey sits at the front of the room with a big sign 
               that says "DETENTION: QUIET!!!!!" The boys sit with their 
               hands crossed and talk in a whisper.

                                     MR. MACKEY
                         Welcome to detention, Mkay? Mr. 
                         Garrison told me about your little 
                         joke. It is important for you to 
                         know WHY you are in detention for 
                         you to obtain the full benefits from 
                         it. You are here because you are 
                         inferior, okay? You are here because 
                         you are awkward, okay?...

               Mr. Mackey continues.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Well Stan, thanks a lot for having 
                         such a cool uncle that got us all 
                         detention for a week.

                                     KYLE
                         Yeah dude, your uncle Jimbo sucks 
                         ass!

                                     MACKEY
                         Ssshh, okay?!

               Mackey shushes the boys. They wait a beat.

                                     STAN
                         Why would he just invent a story 
                         instead of just telling us the truth?

                                     CARTMAN
                         Well, let's see maybe 'cuz he's an 
                         old drunk hillbilly dick!

                                     MACKEY
                         SSSSHH, okay?!

                                     KYLE
                         We got to get him back dude.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Totally.

                                     STAN
                         How?

                                     KYLE
                         Well, he screwed us by making 
                         something up... I say we do the same 
                         thing.

                                     STAN
                         Well, what do you mean?

                                     KYLE
                         Did you ever see that one Brady Bunch 
                         where the guy...

                                     CARTMAN
                         Oh yeah sweet, sweet!

               The boys all lean in to hear Kyle's whispering.

                         And now back to 'Huntin' and Killin'' 
                         with South Park's favorite hunters -- 
                         Jimbo and Ned!

               EXT. JIMBO AND NED'S PORCH

               Jimbo and Ned are on camera again.

                                     JIMBO
                         Welcome hunters! Boy have we got a 
                         show for you today! We have just 
                         received a tape from ANOTHER viewer 
                         who filmed the Mexican Staring Frog 
                         of Southern Sri Lanka RIGHT HERE IN 
                         SOUTH PARK!!

                                     NED
                         Agh!

                                     JIMBO
                         Yes, now we're about to roll the 
                         film, but remember, if you look the 
                         Mexican Staring Frog in the eyes, 
                         you can go catatonic. We don't know 
                         if this applies to PICTURES of the 
                         frog or not, but who wants to take 
                         chances? So when we roll this film, 
                         be sure to look away.

               Jimbo and Ned cover their eyes and look away from the video 
               screen.

                                     JIMBO
                         Okay, roll the film, Tom!

               FOOTAGE of an obviously fake little frog sitting on a front 
               porch. It just sits there. For a long time. It doesn't move.

               Jimbo and Ned keep their eyes off of it. The camera guy looks 
               away as well.

                                     JIMBO
                         Is it over?

               Jimbo sneaks a look at the screen just as the image 
               disappears.

                                     JIMBO
                         Okay, it's over.

               Everyone goes back to normal.

                                     JIMBO
                         Well, there you have it. Undeniable 
                         PROOF that the Mexican Staring Frog 
                         of Southern Sri Lanka exists!!!! And 
                         you saw it HERE on the Jimbo and Ned 
                         show!

               INT. KYLE'S HOUSE - DAY

               The boys are all on the couch watching the show.

                                     KYLE
                         Dude! I can't believe they fell for 
                         it!

                                     STAN
                         Yeah what a couple of dumbasses!

                         Mph rmph rm rmph rmph rm!

               The boys all laugh.

                                     STAN
                         Yeah!

                                     KYLE
                         Come on, we gotta go make another 
                         one!

               The boys all head out the door.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Lying kicks ass!

                         Yeah?

               Jesus is getting his face powdered.

                                     PRODUCER
                         We're in trouble. The Jimbo and Ned 
                         show made up some ridiculous staring 
                         frog story and jumped another two 
                         points in the ratings!

                                     JESUS
                         Oh, oh. So what are we supposed to 
                         do?

                                     PRODUCER
                         I don't know. We'll have to continue 
                         with the changes we've made, and 
                         then go even further...

               Riki lake music starts as the Jesus and Pals logo glides 
               past the frame.

               Jesus is in the audience a la Riki.

                                     JESUS
                         If you're just joining us, we've 
                         been listening to Michelle's 
                         incredible story of survival. Go on, 
                         Michelle.

                                     WOMAN GUEST
                              (in tears)
                         Well, as I was saying, I tried and 
                         tried but the overturned car just 
                         wouldn't budge. My husband was trapped 
                         for twelve hours.

                                     JESUS
                         And yet somehow he managed to survive.

                                     WOMAN GUEST
                         That's right. He's a very brave man 
                         and I love him very much.

               The man guest smiles at the woman. His head is flat like a 
               pancake and his arm sticks out of his back.

                                     MAN GUEST
                         I mov oo too.

                                     JESUS
                         Well, let's see if the audience has 
                         any questions.
                              (beat)
                         Yes, you over there --

               Jesus trots over to a large ugly woman.

                                     WOMAN
                         I think she needs to kick him to the 
                         curb, baby!

               Jesus looks confused.

                                     JESUS
                         Kick WHO to the curb?

                                     WOMAN
                         Her no good husband!! She's gotta 
                         lose that zero and get herself a 
                         hero!!!

               The crowd goes wild.

                                     JESUS
                         But --

               Another woman stands up next to her.

                                     WOMAN 2
                         He wants to have his cake and eat it 
                         too! He's gotta dump that trash, 
                         girlfriend! It's all about respect! 
                         You gotta have respect for yourSELF!

               The woman guest looks extremely confused.

                                     JESUS
                         Uh... I think we've somewhat missed 
                         the point here, let's go to somebody 
                         else...

               Jesus goes to another audience member.

                                     JESUS
                         Yes, your comments?

                                     BLACK MAN
                         Montel, I think we're forgetting 
                         something very important in all of 
                         this. Okay, sure he touched some 
                         children, but the man is a great 
                         singer and he has entertained us for 
                         so many years.

                                     JESUS
                         What are you talking about?

                                     BLACK MAN
                         Michael Jackson. All this bad mouthing 
                         and putting the man down. Maybe he 
                         did touch some children now and then, 
                         but come on! It's Michael Jackson. 
                         Michael Jackson!

               People applaud. Jesus pulls the mic away from the man.

                                     JESUS
                         Uh... We'll be back right after these 
                         messages...

               EXT. SOUTH PARK FOREST - CAMERA - DAY

               Through an unsteady videocamera, we see a blurry picture of 
               a small bush in the forest.

               Suddenly, it starts to shake slightly. Then, a dark blur 
               appears at one side of the screen behind the bush. It hops a 
               couple of times. Cartman is holding a stupid little plastic 
               frog on a string by the end of a stick.

                                     CARTMAN (O.S.)

               Indeed, Cartman has a little gray wig and a dress on. Kyle

                         you and you have to be scared --

                         the Mexican Staring Frog will look 
                         you in the eyes, then you fall down

                         Well, it appears as though a lot of 
                         you SKEPTICS thought that the film 
                         we showed of the Mexican Staring 
                         Frog Of Southern Sri Lanka was a 
                         FAKE. They say it didn't HARM 
                         anybody... Well, it just so happens 
                         that we just received ANOTHER film 
                         from ANOTHER anonymous viewer! ROLL 
                         IT!

               The shitty little film that the boys made appears on the 
               screen. The stupid plastic frog bounces through frame. It 
               then cuts to Cartman, as the old lady who sees the frog, and 
               then passes out. Then we see Kenny moon the camera.

                         There you go! PROOF that not only is 
                         this frog REAL, but it is doing harm 
                         to people of South Park AS WE SPEAK!!

                         Oh no, no, no! This is the biggest 
                         publicity stunt I've ever seen. Damn 
                         those hunters are clever!

                         Mexican Staring Frog! Unless...

                         Unless we can prove to the world 
                         that the whole thing is a sham. If 
                         we prove that the Mexican Staring 
                         Frog of Southern Sri Lanka is just 
                         something made up by Jimbo and Ned, 
                         we can have them taken off the air. 
                         Perhaps even KILLED!

                         show. People will watch again.

                         investigation. And in the meantime

                         Man, I was in Tet. We had a badass 
                         roller coaster. But all we ever wanted 
                         was a log ride... We waited and we 
                         waited... But they never built us 
                         one.

               Jimbo and Ned look sad as they listen to the tale.

                         I think Danforth wanted a log ride 
                         more than anybody but he... He had 
                         to settle with that lame dinosaur 
                         water adventure ride...

                         -- Jimbo, look.

               Ned points to a rock behind them all where the little plastic 
               frog sits motionless.

                                     JIMBO

                         It's him! The Mexican Staring Frog 
                         of Southern Sri Lanka! He's right 
                         over there on that rock!

                         He is?

               The producer peers up over the rock. Jimbo quickly yanks his 
               head back down.

                                     JIMBO

                         eyes away from him! STAY DOWN! Ned, 
                         you take flank position, I'll try 
                         and keep it turned away from you.

                                     JIMBO
                              (into camera)
                         Hello fellow hunters. Have we got a 
                         show for you today! The Mexican 
                         Staring Frog is sunning itself on a 
                         rock directly behind us.

               Ned runs around and hides behind a tree, making sure the 
               whole time not to look at the little plastic frog.

                                     JIMBO
                         We've got to take the frog by 
                         surprise.

               Jimbo takes out a grenade.

                                     JIMBO
                         I'm going to create a diversion using 
                         this incendiary device, while Ned 
                         will ambush him from the rear.

               Jimbo throws the bomb over his shoulder. BOOOOM! It blows a 
               huge hole in the ground right next to the little plastic 
               frog.

                                     JIMBO
                         NOW NED! HE'S NOT LOOKING!!!

               Ned rushes in with the flamethrower.

                                     JIMBO
                         QUICK NED! HIT HIM WITH THE SHOTGUN! 
                         NOW NED!!!

               Nothing. No sound.

                                     JIMBO
                         Ned?!... Ned????

               Jimbo peeks over to the rock. Ned stands a few feet from the 
               frog, not moving.

                                     JIMBO
                         Oh no...

               Ned is caught in the gaze of the frog. Little concentric 
               circles surround his eyes. He drops his gun.

                                     NED
                         Zzzzzz...

                                     JIMBO
                         Come on Ned buddy, snap out of it!

               But Ned is catatonic. He can't move at all.

                                     JIMBO
                         Come back to me buddy!!

                                     PRODUCER
                              (to cameraguy)
                         You getting all this?

               The camera guy nods.

                                     JIMBO
                              (to camera)
                         Hold onto your butts...

               Jimbo jumps up with his gun and BLASTS the little plastic 
               frog off the rock.

                                     JIMBO
                         TAKE THAT YOU DEMON FROG!!!

               Ned is still catatonic. Jimbo shakes him.

                                     JIMBO
                         Ned?! Ned?! Can you hear me?! Quick! 
                         Somebody call an ambulance! This man 
                         is catatonic!

                         Get the Flight for Life helicopter!

               The kids all climb out of the bushes.

                                     STAN
                         Holy crap, dude.

               EXT. HOSPITAL - DAY

               Establishing.

               INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

               Jimbo is sitting beside Ned's bed reading a book. Ned is 
               still catatonic. The Producer is standing off to the side.

                                     JIMBO
                              (reading)
                         But Pony Boy was beat up pretty bad. 
                         He kept saying 'Stay Gold'.

               Jimbo closes the book.

                                     JIMBO
                         Aw, Ned... If you can hear me... You 
                         gotta snap out of it. 'Cause if you 
                         don't, I'll never forgive myself.

               Ned is still catatonic.

               The boys walk in to find Jimbo drying his tears.

                                     JIMBO
                         Oh, Stanly! He's gone! My only friend 
                         in the world is gone!

                                     STAN
                         Dude! He's okay! That frog wasn't 
                         even real! Look --

               Stan holds up another plastic frog.

                                     JIMBO
                         AGH!! What the hell are you doing?! 
                         I almost looked right at that!!

                                     STAN
                         Dude, it's just a plastic frog. It's 
                         not real. Check it out --

               He hands the frog to Jimbo. Jimbo examines it.

                                     JIMBO
                         ...What?

                                     STAN
                         We shot all those videos and sent 
                         them in.

                                     KYLE
                         Yeah, we made the whole thing up. It 
                         was all just a really really funny 
                         joke.

                                     JIMBO
                         You sent in those videos?!!!!

                                     PRODUCER
                         Oh, this is not good.

                                     JIMBO
                         My best friend is a vegetable and 
                         I'm going to be the laughing stock 
                         of South Park!

                                     KYLE
                         Aw come on! Ned's faking it! That 
                         frog was just a piece of plastic.

                                     STAN
                         Yeah, come on Ned, quit faking!

                                     JIMBO
                         You boys don't understand. Ned was 
                         so freaked out by the idea of the 
                         Mexican Staring Frog that he must 
                         have sent himself into a deep coma!

               Stan and Kyle look at each other concerned.

                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                         It's a psycho-somatic response.

               We PAN over to the doorway where the Jesus and Pal's producer 
               who is standing just outside the room holding one of those 
               telescopic microphones that is used in football games.

                                     PRODUCER
                         I couldn't help overhearing your 
                         conversation just now.

               The producer walks in.

                                     KYLE
                         Who are you?

                                     PRODUCER
                         I produce a little TV show called 
                         Jesus and Pals. You might have heard 
                         of it. Your story is AMAZING! Full 
                         of jealousy, duplicity, backstabbing 
                         and bitterness!

                                     JIMBO
                         Uh... thanks?

                                     PRODUCER
                         How would you like to share your 
                         remarkable story with us on tomorrow's 
                         show?

               INT. TELEVISION STUDIO

               CHEEZY MUSIC. Lights search the crowd. Superimposed titles 
               read "Tots in Trouble!"

               Jimbo and the boys are on stage. Ned sits next to Jimbo still 
               catatonic.

                                     JESUS
                         We're back with Jimbo and his nephew 
                         Stan. These kids can't stop lying, 
                         can they?

                                     JIMBO
                         That's right Jesus. No respect for 
                         their elders. As some of you may 
                         know, I host a local show on hunting --

               A smattering of applause.

                                     JIMBO
                         Thanks. We've been hunting the Mexican 
                         Staring Frog for a week based on 
                         some video footage we received from 
                         a viewer. Well, it turns out that 
                         these kids FAKED the footage!

                                     JESUS
                         Is this true, Stan?

                                     STAN
                         It was just a joke. We didn't think 
                         it would hurt anybody.

               Jesus looks at the producer who signals for a commercial.

                                     JESUS
                         We'll find out more about this 
                         debauchery when we return!

               Music kicks in and the camera BOOMS off of Jesus.

                                     AD
                         And we're... OUT!

               Producers rush the stage.

                                     PRODUCER
                         You're corpses up here!! We need A 
                         LOT more action from everybody!

                                     JIMBO
                         Like what?

                                     PRODUCER
                         Like go ahead and tell how your nephew 
                         Stan takes drugs and worships Satan.

                                     JIMBO
                         Satan. Got it.

                                     STAN
                         Whoa, I don't take drugs and worship 
                         Satan! That's lying!

                                     JIMBO
                         Give you a taste of your own medicine 
                         you little fibber!

                                     PRODUCER
                         And you kids! I didn't bring you on 
                         this show to be boring! Somebody get 
                         pissed and throw a chair at Ned here.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Dibs!

                                     PRODUCER
                         Remember, you all start to fight 
                         after the chair is thrown. That's 
                         your cue!

                                     JIMBO
                         Righty.

               Music kicks in. The audience goes wild.

                                     JESUS
                         Welcome back to Jesus and Pals! Jimbo, 
                         why do you think little Stanly lies?

                                     JIMBO
                         I'll tell you why... Because he's on 
                         drugs and he worships the devil!!!

               The crowd GASPS! Stan sits in shock.

                                     AUDIENCE
                         JESUS!!! JESUS!!!! JESUS!!!

                                     JESUS
                         Wow. Now Stanly, it sounds like your 
                         uncle is really worried about you.

                                     STAN
                         Well... I only did it because he 
                         molested me!!!

               GASP!!! Jesus' jaw drops. Two producers high-five behind the 
               camera.

                                     JIMBO
                         Why you little piece of crap!

                                     STAN
                         You big piece of crap!!

                                     CARTMAN
                         That's it, now I'm all pissed off!!!

               Cartman picks up a chair and wings it at Ned. It hits him on 
               the head but he doesn't move an inch.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Take that hippie!

                                     JIMBO
                         HEY!!!

               He picks up his chair and throws it at Stan. Stan ducks and 
               it hits a lady in the crowd.

                                     AUDIENCE
                         JESUS!!! JESUS!!!!

                                     JESUS
                         Okay, okay. That's enough!

               She dashes up and attacks Jimbo.

                                     LADY IN THE CROWD
                         TAKE THAT YOU ASSHOLE!!!

                                     LADY IN THE CROWD
                         What the fuck was that?!

                                     JESUS
                         Uh, let's watch the language people --

                                     JIMBO
                         BRING IT ON YOU BITCH!!!

                                     CARTMAN
                         HEY GET OFF OF HIM YOU FUCKIN' NUT 
                         SACK!!!

               Cartman jumps on them. The crowd jumps on the boys. A huge 
               melee ensues.

                                     KENNY
                         Mrph mrph!!

               Two angry crowd members have Kenny between them in a tug of 
               war. They tug and tug.

                                     JESUS
                         Let's all make our way back to our 
                         seats.

                                     KENNY
                         MMMMRPPH!!

               They RIP him in half, killing him instantly.

                                     STAN
                         OH MY GOD! THEY KILLED KENNY!!!

                                     KYLE
                         YOU BASTARDS!!!

                                     JESUS
                         Let's all make our way back to our 
                         seats.

               No one notices. The fights continue. Full-on chaos. The 
               dialogue is a continuous BLEEEP.

                                     JESUS
                         SHUT THE FUCK UP!!!!

               Silence. Everyone looks at Jesus.

                                     JESUS
                         Jesus, what is wrong with you people!?

               People look ashamed. Everyone disentangles themselves from 
               their respective piles.

                                     JESUS
                         Look around you Stanly. Look at all 
                         the pain and suffering your lie has 
                         caused.

                                     STAN
                         Well we only did it because Jimbo 
                         lied to us first. We had this report 
                         on the Vietnam War for school and we 
                         interviewed Jimbo about it. He made 
                         up all this stuff about Vietnam and 
                         he got us in trouble!!

                                     JIMBO
                         Hey now, everything that I told you 
                         about the war actually happened!

                                     STAN
                         Mr. Garrison said there was no way 
                         that you could have defeated the 
                         entire Viet Cong by yourself.

               The audience gets really silent.

                                     JESUS
                         The ENTIRE Vietcong army?

               Jimbo looks around nervously.

                                     JIMBO
                         I, uh... Well okay, I might have 
                         EMBELLISHED the truth a little, but 
                         that's different.

                                     JESUS
                         Is it?

                                     JIMBO
                         Well sure, I mean... well no, I guess 
                         not.

                                     JESUS
                         And as for you Stan, I think you 
                         need to kick your drug habit and --

                                     STAN
                         Wait a second, I don't take drugs! 
                         That was a lie!

                                     JESUS
                         Wait, Jimbo made that up?

                                     STAN
                         No, your producer did. She made Jimbo 
                         tell everybody that I did drugs.

               Jesus smiles drops.

                                     JESUS
                         What?!

                                     STAN
                         During the break. Your producer came 
                         over and told Jimbo what to say about 
                         me. She told him to lie!

                                     JIMBO
                         It's true, she did. I'm such a tool.

                                     JESUS
                         Oh really?

               Jesus looks over at his producer who is trying to hide behind 
               a small plant.

                                     KYLE
                         Yeah, then she told us to throw a 
                         chair at Ned!

                                     CARTMAN
                         Yeah, I didn't want to do it Jesus! 
                         They made me do it!!

               The crowd gets up and starts to bail.

                                     MAN IN THE CROWD
                         Screw this show! I thought this was 
                         all real!

               The whole crowd walks out the door, right by Jesus.

                                     JESUS
                         Wait everybody! Come back!

               But they all leave. Jesus drops the mike.

                                     BLACK MAN
                         Don't feel too bad Montel. We all 
                         want to touch children sometimes, 
                         it's only natural...

               COMMERCIAL BREAK - EPILOGUE

               EXT. TELEVISION STUDIO

               Jesus, Jimbo, Ned and the boys stand outside the studio.

                                     JIMBO
                         I'm sorry Stan, I was just trying to 
                         tell a good story. I never meant for 
                         you boys to get in trouble.

                                     STAN
                         We're sorry too Uncle Jimbo. We're 
                         sorry for making you look stupid in 
                         front of the whole world.

                                     KYLE
                         Yeah, and we're sorry for turning 
                         Ned into a vegetable.

                                     JIMBO
                         Ah, he'll be fine. I'll just take 
                         him home and show him some good hard-
                         core porn and he'll snap out of it. 
                         Won't you Ned?

               Jimbo slaps Ned on the back. He falls over on his face.

               Jesus walks in.

                                     JESUS
                         I want to apologize to all of you 
                         for what happened in there. in our 
                         competition for ratings we all lost 
                         sight of why we got into show business 
                         in the first place.

                                     JIMBO
                         Yeah, titties and beer.

                                     JESUS
                         Actually I was referring more to the 
                         pursuit of truth but... Well anyway, 
                         I can't wait to get back to my old 
                         show without all the glitz and ratings 
                         and producers...

                                     STAN
                         Wait a sec. Where IS your producer?

                                     JESUS
                         I sent her away.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Sent her away where?

               INT. HELL - DAY

               The producer is horrified as she walks around the flames of 
               hell with pitchforks stabbing her ass.

                                     PRODUCER
                         WHAT IS THIS?! WHAT'S HAPPENING?!

                                     SATAN
                         Welcome to my dominion.

                                     PRODUCER
                         Aaaah...

               The producer looks confused.

                                     SADAM HUSSEIN
                         Eh, take a load off, put your feet 
                         up! Me and Satan were just aboot to 
                         go shopping for furniture. Come on 
                         Satan.

                                     SATAN
                         Okay honey.

               They walk off hand in hand.

               The producer looks up to the heavens.

                                     PRODUCER
                         NOOOOOOOOOOOoooooooooo!!!

                                         THE END
